\section*{Graphing Linear Equations}

Below each video, you’ll find a set of practice problems. Try those problems first. If you run into any difficulties, go back and rewatch the video, then attempt the problems again. This way, you’ll reinforce what you’ve learned and build a stronger understanding.
